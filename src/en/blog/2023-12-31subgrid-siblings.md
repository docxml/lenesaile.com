Subgrids use the grid tracks of an ancestor grid to align their grid items. For example, you can create a number of columns on the `<body>` element and pass them "down", no matter how deep. The gist here: the grid system that will be passed down **must** be on an ancestor. Subgrid searches up the DOM tree for the nearest element that defines a column or row template (`grid-template columns` or `grid-template-rows`) that is _not_ marked as a subgrid.

So if I create a layout on the `<body>` element, I can transfer it to the landmarks `<header>`, `<main>` and `<footer>`, which will then effect their children.

## Can the actual dimensions of the grid be defined by a sibling?

What I want to achieve is aligning siblings vertically: the dynamic dimensions of elements inside the `<header>` landmark shall implement the grid column template defined on the `<body>` element. The grid lines should "nestle" against the SVG logo and the site name next to it. Elements inside of `<main>` and `<footer>` should be able to participate in this grid, placing their own children alongside the dimensions of the logo and the site name.

Specifically, the H1 is to span the entire column, and I want the contents inside the `<section>` element and the paragraph in the `<footer>` to start at the height of the beginning site title. The `<nav>` in the `<footer>` should place itself just where the site title ends.

Grid and subgrid are not topics that are easy to understand at first. I therefore try to get to the result in detail and step by step.

The HTML looks like this:

{% raw %}

```html
<body class="wrapper flow">
  <header>
    <a class="logo" href="#">
      <svg
        viewBox="0 0 100 100"
        width="1em"
        height="1em"
        xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
      >
        <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="50" />
      </svg>
      <span>Marzipan</span>
    </a>
    <nav class="cluster" aria-label="Main">
      <ul class="cluster" role="list">
        <li>
          <a href="#">Cake</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="#">Ice cream</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="#">Candy</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </header>

  <main class="flow">
    <h1>Cupcake cake candy chupa chups tart marzipan chocolate bar</h1>
    <section>
      <p>
        Halvah shortbread topping muffin cookie gingerbread bear claw. Cheesecake oat cake

        croissant. Dessert marshmallow sesame snaps liquorice jelly beans powder

        Croissant croissant jelly ice cream jelly-o tootsie roll shortbread chocolate bar.
      </p>
    </section>
  </main>

  <footer>
    <p class="copyright">© 2024</p>
    <nav aria-label="Complementary">
      <ul class="cluster" role="list">
        <li>
          <a href="#">Imprint</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="#">Privacy</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </footer>
</body>
```

{% endraw %}

## The grid system

The grid system is defined for the `<body>` element. In the grid setup I create implicit grid areas with named lines, so I can easily reference them later:

```css
body {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns:
    [full-start] min-content
    [logo-text-start] min-content
    [logo-text-end] 1fr
    [full-end];
  grid-template-rows:
    [header] auto
    [main] 1fr
    [footer] auto;
}
```

The `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows` properties create explicit grid tracks: the grid columns should wrap tightly around the SVG logo and then align with the site title. `min-content` does that for us: it [represents the intrinsic minimum width of the content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/min-content).
This grid track will become just as small as the widest content element that places itself in this column. We must therefore ensure that only the SVG and the site title do this.

The remaining available space is reserved for the menu, the `fr` unit makes sure of that.

The explicit rows specify that the `<header>` and `<footer>` should have a height determined by their content, while `<main>` should take up the remaining space. This places the `<footer>` at the bottom of the viewport. To prevent the elements in `<main>` from splitting up weirdly when there is little content, I also set the rule `main {place-content: start;}`.

Without subgrid, the landmarks now jam themselves in the tracks given to them.

{% codepen "https://codepen.io/madrilene/pen/LYapGMy", "result" %}
Subgrid: Inheriting grid tracks from a sibling - first step
{% endcodepen %}

We can counteract this by having them take up the entire column width:

```css
body > * {
  grid-column: 1/-1;
}
```

But, instead of using the notation `1/-1` for the entire width, we can also use our name mechanism.
The named lines created a named area, which I can now reference as "full":

```css
body > * {
  grid-column: full;
}
```

The grid-template columns set in the `<body>` element shall now be adopted by the three children of the `<body>`.

```css
body > * {
  grid-column: full;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: subgrid;
}
```

It is no longer the landmarks themselves that are placed in the grid, but _their children_, as if the grid column blueprint were defined in the landmarks themselves. It is not just a copy of the value, the three elements literally use the grid tracks of the body.

Now the children of the three landmarks determine the dimensions of the grid, but it is the wrong element that defines the width: according to `min-content`, the longest word of the Heading element inside of `<main>` now defines the dimensions of the first grid area.

All three landmarks have only two children, so the third column is empty.

Subgrid: Inheriting grid tracks from a sibling - second step
{% endcodepen %}

Let us first free the children of the `<main>` element from the task of determining the grid dimensions. We want them to span the entire available width of the wrapper, which in our case only affects the H1, because everything in the `<section>` element should be aligned where the site title begins.

```css
main > * {
  grid-column: full;
}

main > section {
  grid-column: logo-text-start / full-end;
}
```

{% codepen "https://codepen.io/madrilene/pen/YzgywMY", "result" %}
Subgrid: Inheriting grid tracks from a sibling - third step
{% endcodepen %}

**Almost!**

We are missing one last step, namely `.logo` with its two children must also inherit the blueprint grid columns.

However, it should extend from `full-start` to `logo-text-end`.

```css
.logo {
  grid-column: full-start / logo-text-end;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: subgrid;
}
```

We skipped several levels, so to speak, until we finally allowed the children of `.logo` to define the dimensions that we can now pass on to the siblings of `<header>` and their children.

## Final grid placements

I set a breakpoint for the `<nav>` element in the `<header>`, so that it is aligned with the site name on the second line for small viewports, and it takes up the area from the end of the site name to the end of the wrapper on wider displays:

```css
header > nav {
  grid-column: logo-text-start / full-end;
}

@media (min-width: 30em) {
  header > nav {
    grid-column: logo-text-end / full-end;
  }
}
```

Finally, the paragraph in the `<footer>` should extend the width of the site name another named area: `logo-text`.
This makes the following `<nav>` take up the remaining space:

```css
footer > p {
  grid-column: logo-text;
}
```

{% codepen "https://codepen.io/madrilene/pen/RwdWrap", "result" %}

{% endcodepen %}

Now we have a layout in which the grid is defined on the `<body>`, but is only really implemented by the children of the `<header>`.

## Remarks

Further down in the CSS you will find all the small settings I have otherwise made, the classes `.cluster` and `.flow` originate from the layout primitives of [every-layout.dev](https://every-layout.dev/), the fluid type and space scales were calculated with the help of [utopia.fyi](https://utopia.fyi/).

Cathy Dutton came up with the idea of using a flexible parent grid column for vertical alignment under siblings back in 2020 in an article published on [css-tricks.com](https://css-tricks.com/achieving-vertical-alignment-thanks-subgrid/#aa-can-grid-help-us).

[Thanks to Bob Monsour's reference](https://indieweb.social/@bobmonsour/111686716289873152) to Ryan Mulligan's article "[Horizontal Scrolling in a Centered Max-Width Container](https://ryanmulligan.dev/blog/x-scrolling-centered-max-width-container/)", I came across an [article by Anna Monus](https://www.annalytic.com/css-subgrid-vs-nested-grid.html) that explains the differences between subgrids and nested grids (`grid-template-columns: subgrid;` and `grid-template-columns: inherit;`).
This is also well worth reading in this context.
