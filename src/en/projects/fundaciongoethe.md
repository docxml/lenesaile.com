lead: 'The non-profit foundation seeks to create socio-economic links between Germany and Spain through culture. I have been working with them for many years. We started the relationship designing the programs of their concerts, the posters of the events and doing maintenance work on the page they had. We continue to collaborate with them maintaining the page, creating the events they organize and managing their social networks.'
