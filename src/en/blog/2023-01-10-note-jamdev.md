On January 25, I'll be participating in [TheJam.dev 2023](https://cfe.dev/events/the-jam-2023/). When I see the [other speakers in the lineup](https://cfe.dev/events/the-jam-2023/#speakers) I can clearly feel the imposter syndrome kicking in... ðŸ˜¬

Anyway, I'm preparing something on internationalization with Eleventy, which I'll pack into a ten-minute lightning talk, and additionally publish an in-depth article on the blog. I'm very excited about the opportunity [Brian Rinaldi](https://cfe.dev/speakers/brian-rinaldi/) has arranged for me!
