lead: 'Stephen found my template [Eleventy-Excellent](https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-excellent) in the [Eleventy starter directory](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/starter/?tags=perfectlh) and spontaneously wrote to me. He desired a central place to write down his thoughts - following the IndieWeb principle ["own your data"](https://indieweb.org/own_your_data). He asked me to customize the starter - equally minimalistic, but according to his color and layout ideas. With a Figma wireframe and a little bit of jumpstart to work with the GitHub and Netlify workflow, Stephen is now very happy with his new online space, and I had an incredible amount of fun implementing a project with a client who knows and values accessibility, performance and progressive enhancement!
