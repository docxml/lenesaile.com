I have created a very small Eleventy page where I go more into detail about my technical knowledge and interests. I needed it for a couple of possible jobs and realized that it is handy to have, should I be asked spontaneously about my skills and tendencies.

I've also added a few book and course tips. Now I just have to make sure I keep it up to date with everything I'm learning all the time. You can find it at [lene.dev](https://www.lene.dev/).
