It is undoubtedly one of the most important features that a web page must have.
A nice design is of little use if the visitor does not understand anything and leaves the page frustrated and vowing not to come back.

It has happened to all of us:

- You are looking for information about the services of a renovation company that someone has recommended and you can't understand what they do or don't do.
- You need to download a document from your children's school website and can't find it.
- You want to buy a specific item from a clothing store, you have a hard time finding the right category, and then there is no way to understand how to actually make the purchase.

Don't even get me started on the websites of public institutions. At least that's the case here in Spain: they are designed to kill you little by little, sending you from one place to another without sense, in a new version of "The Process" by Kafka.

Time is one of the most important things for people, and feeling well treated and respected is also fundamental. Hence the need to take into account when creating a website, the quality of the texts and the layout of the contents.

It is that simple: ==if they do not understand you, they will not trust you, they will not hire you, they will not buy from you, and they will not come back to your website==.

I take all these aspects into account in the pages we create.
