lead: 'Reder is a coalition of NGOs, collectives, movements, organisations and individuals that campaigns for universal access to healthcare in Spain and denounces exclusion in the healthcare system. This site has been designed with performance and accessibility in mind. This should help visitors - in many cases socially excluded people such as refugees - to find their way around quickly. No fonts are specified, but the system font stack is used to contribute to performance. The editorial team had experience with Wordpress and requested this system. Only five plugins are activated on the site: Advanced Custom Fields PRO, Akismet Anti-Spam, SiteGround Security, WP Rocket Pro and Yoast SEO.'
