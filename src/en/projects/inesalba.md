lead: "Inés is an actress, singer and dubbing artist. These multiple talents needed to be represented on the website as well. At the same time, I wanted to reflect the actress' convertibility, which is why the website has a clear and simple structure. Inés is a cheerful and positive person, it is particularly easy to work with her. This quality is also captured by small playful accents and colours."
