I make sure that a website is ==fast and loads only what is necessary==. Everyone should be able to find their way around immediately and the website should be ==accessible and usable for all people==. I am a humble learner in this field and adjust my knowledge on a daily basis.

I do not create websites based on premade templates/themes and I do not use Website Builders. All websites are designed and developed from the ground up so that they work exactly as I and my clients imagine them to.

This approach has various advantages:

1. No image is too big, no code is too much - and the website runs error-free and fast.
2. I am independent of third parties, I react to problems and necessary updates myself.
3. The websites of my clients achieve a very good positioning in the search engines.
4. Almost all ideas can be fulfilled in terms of form, structure and function.
