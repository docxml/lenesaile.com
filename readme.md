## License

This is my personal website. I use a lot of code fragments that smarter people than me have come up with, so it's only right to release my code open source as well. Please feel free to use parts of the code of this website in your own projects, but please don't copy the page completely, as it's not meant to be a template.

## Credits and Thank yous

**Andy Bell**

Andys CSS methodology makes sense to me. I'm still working on understanding it fully and using it consistently. It also goes hand in hand with the Every Layout solutions he co-authors. An ardent opponent of the utility class framework Tailwind CSS. But has recently published an approach that incorporates Tailwind CSS into his methodology. This is built into my website and I'm working on tweaking it.
I learned how to use Eleventy in 2020 with his (now free) course.

**Bernard Nijenhuis**

The open graph images are generated automatically: First a SVG is created for every post, which is then converted to JPEG. I learned how to do that with Bernard's article.

**Aleksandr Hovhannisyan**

I love structure and clarity. Aleksandr does this in an exemplary way, which is why I based the structure of eleventy.js on his personal site. The 301 redirect solution I'm using is from his blog.
