lead: "Alberto is part of the family, so we played at home with this project. The website, created with the Jamstack method (Eleventy, Netlify, Stripe), had to represent the dynamism, strength and electricity of the singer-songwriter's new album. The website has a shop to sell records and other merchandising products. In addition to the website, we are responsible for the design and photography of the image of the new album."
