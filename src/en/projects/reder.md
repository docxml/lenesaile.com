lead: 'Reder is a coalition of NGOs, collectives, movements, organisations and individuals that campaigns for universal access to healthcare in Spain and denounces exclusion in the healthcare system. This site is all about performance and accessibility, helping visitors - in many cases socially excluded people such as refugees - to find their way around quickly. The system font stack is used to contribute to performance. Only five plugins are activated on the site: Advanced Custom Fields PRO, Akismet Anti-Spam, SiteGround Security, WP Rocket Pro and Yoast SEO.'
