## What is website speed?

Web performance is about everyone being able to access a web page quickly without having to overcome unnecessary obstacles.

When a customer goes to eat at a restaurant, slow service often leads to bad reviews and, consequently, fewer future customers. Similarly, a slow website speed can lead to poor Google rankings and less traffic to the website. The so-called "user experience" also suffers.

## The website as an "experience

Visitors are more demanding than ever. Visiting a website is no longer about simply finding the desired information.

It's about helping the visitor get to their destination as easily and quickly as possible. It is about the quality of the user's interaction with a website and also about their perception of it.

The time a visitor spends on your website should be a pleasant "experience", something that is perceived positively during the visit and, ideally, remembered as such.

## Why are fast web pages so important?

Speed plays a very important role in this. High-performing websites retain users better than low-performing ones. User retention, in turn, is critical to improving conversion rates (the percentage of users who complete a desired action).

Therefore, the better the performance, the more likely users are to stay on a page, read content, make purchases or dial your phone number.

Google's search engine also wants users to have a good "experience" on the web, so fast web pages also rank better in search results. A slow website can cause you to end up on page 312 in search results, regardless of any other metric.

A 2017 study by Akamai (a corporation that provides a content delivery network, "CDN") claimed that as little as a 100ms delay in loading a page can mean a 7% drop in conversions and that 1% of revenue is lost for every 100ms of load time, which at the time of the study equated to $1.6 billion if the page was just one second slower.

Akamai also found that 75% of potential shoppers abandon a shop if it takes too long to load or because the checkout process is too complicated.

## Especially on cell phones, the site has to be fast

People are increasingly using their cell phones to access digital content and services. When I look at our clients' website analytics, I see this trend reflected in the data. A typical split is 60% mobile (with a small proportion of tablets) and 40% desktop and laptop.

The performance of a website can vary greatly depending on the user's device, network conditions or other processes running on the device. If you find your website fast enough on a computer with fiber-optic Internet, a user with an older cell phone with mobile data may experience it very differently.

Therefore, it is important to optimize websites especially for cell phones, especially in the speed category.

## How do you make the page fast?

Some developers and operators often do not consider performance important. Performance is then a sort of add-on feature that can be taken care of later instead of including it from the beginning.

This is often seen with Wordpress templates: first the complete multifunctional theme and lots of plugins are loaded on the server, and then another plugin is installed that is supposed to automatically minimize and optimize all of the above. However, there are only a very limited number of possibilities that can lead to a speed increase with little effort.

## Measures to speed up your website

The list of methods and best practices to achieve optimal speed is long. At the end of the day, the visual experience should not suffer, i.e. we want images that showcase your facilities or products, and we want a web font that reflects the character of your company.

Both elements, images and fonts, are individually optimized so that they are no longer a hindrance to speed.

The following is a very basic list of measures that should always be followed:

1. Use a good quality host.
2. Program a lightweight single page
3. Optimize all components such as scripts, fonts and images.
4. Use caching
5. Use a content delivery network (CDN).
