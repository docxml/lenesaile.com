I have always enjoyed experimenting with computers. In 2004, I tried building my first websites with HTML and CSS. Four years later, I started earning a living with my hobby.

After reaching my limits with static websites, I discovered [WordPress](/en/blog/some-random-personal-notes-on-using-wordpress-in-2022/) and learned PHP to broaden the possibilities.

In 2018 I came across the Jamstack approach and as a consequence revamped all my workflows. I started integrating Git by default for all projects, tested new bundlers, CSS and Javscript frameworks and discovered the world of continuous deployments via GitHub and Netlify.

I enjoy building ==fast websites== with minimal vanilla Javascript and all the ==possibilities of modern CSS==.

I'm especially enthusiastic about everything that's happening in the areas of Jamstack, accessibility and performance. These are the main fields in which I am continuously and passionately educating myself.
