## Planning and design

Every project starts with planning. This way I can get a more concrete feel for the project. I study websites from the same industry and look for inspiration. I start thinking about typography and color scheme and create a project folder where the client's material is stored.

The next step is to create a menu and I sketch out the design and elements of the website. My sketches are not very detailed, nor do they describe every part of the website. The main purpose is to have a general idea of the project.

With Photoshop and Figma programs I convert my ideas and sketches into designs. Sometimes I solve each subpage completely, sometimes I convert the idea in my head directly into code.

## Code and release

When the design is agreed with my client, I use the code editor "Visual Studio Code" to convert the design into modern and efficient code, using HTML, CSS and Javascript. If you want a readable CMS, I build the design directly as a new Wordpress theme. I also work with the new technique for static websites "Jamstack", which is especially useful for small websites.

In the testing phase I check that everything works correctly: Does the website run on all common browsers and operating systems, do the contact forms arrive, does the DSGVO module and visitor analysis work correctly?

Everything is now loaded on the server. The site is running without errors on my local server - now I check that this is also the case on the live server. Finally I publish the website.
