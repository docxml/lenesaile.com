  intro: I have been working as a web developer for over 15 years.

I mainly work with the Jamstack architecture and Wordpress.

I make sure that a website is ==fast and loads only what is necessary==. The visitor should be able to find his way around immediately and the website should be ==accessible and usable for all people== regardless of any disability.

I do not create websites based on pre-programmed templates and I do not use visual website builders. All websites are designed and developed from the ground up so that they work exactly as I and my clients imagine them to.

This approach has various advantages:

1. No image is too big, no code is too much - and the website runs error-free and fast.
2. I am independent of third parties, I react to problems and necessary updates myself.
3. The websites of my clients achieve a very good positioning in the search engines.
4. All ideas can be fulfilled in terms of form, structure and function.
