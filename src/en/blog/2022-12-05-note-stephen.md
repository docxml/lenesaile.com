Based on Andy Bell's "be the browser's mentor" workflow for buildexcellentwebsit.es, I recently published a [starter project for Eleventy](https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-excellent). Stephen Anfield, graduate student at the University of Michigan School of Social Work, came across it and asked me to customize the template for him. That's how his new personal website on [stephenanfield.com](https://stephenanfield.com/blog/hello-its-me/) came to be.

Rarely have I enjoyed a project so much! How wonderful it is when someone genuinly appreciates the value and importance of progressive enhancement, performance and accessibility.
Thank you Stephen! :)
