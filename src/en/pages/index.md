  title: I make highly optimized custom websites.
  intro: I have been working as a web developer for over 15 years. As a freelancer and on behalf of agencies I have designed and developed countless personalized websites for small and medium-sized enterprises, freelancers, individuals, associations and foundations. I mainly work with the Jamstack architecture and technologies of the web platform.

I make sure that a website is ==fast and loads only what is necessary.== Everyone should be able to find their way around immediately and a website should be ==accessible and usable for as many people as possible.== The field of accessibility is huge and complex - I am constantly learning.

I do not create websites based on premade templates/themes and I do not use website builders. I plan, design and program all websites from scratch.

This approach has various advantages:

1. No image is too big, no code is too much - and the website runs error-free and fast.
2. I am independent of third parties, I react to problems and necessary updates myself.
3. Semantically structured websites with good content are highly discoverable.
4. We can realize almost anything we can imagine!
